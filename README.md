# Power-Consumption-Prediction-Using-LSTM-

Problem Framing :
Given the recent power consumption of a household, what is the expected consumption for the week ahead taking into consideration the impact of different climatic changes and months on the toll.


Problem approach:
several methods can be implemented to solve this problem , the one I find interesting is the LSTM RNN . 


Earnings:
a model of this type could be helpful for electric consumption prediciton for a family to avoid crossing the bounds . it could also help the electric supplier predict and estimate the electric capacities on demand by a household to avoid falling short of.
